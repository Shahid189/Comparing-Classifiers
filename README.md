# Comparing-Classifiers
Comparing various Classifying Algorithm after feature engineering and finding the best tuning parameters 

Used the following models 
- MLP using both scikit learn and Keras
- Random Forest 
- Decision Tree 
- Pruned Decision Tree
- LDA
- KNN 

Got the confusion matrix, found out sensitivity, sensibility,
Precision score, recall and F1 score along with ROC curve
